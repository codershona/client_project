# Client Project
Working to Full Stack J to S Roadmap

## Working with SSH
### Task 1
The first task will be I had to setup the SSH on our github account?
* SSH is known as Secure shell is a protocol. Such as, protocols are HTTP, HTTPS, FTP. HTTP is known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol which allow us to send files over the internet like a HTML, SS and JS files between browsers and servers. FTP is known as File Transfer Protocol which allows us to send files as well and it is often used to upload the files such as Hostgator or a Generic Hosting platform from our computer. HTTPS is alike to HTTP but its encrypted. The third parties can not read the files being transfered if they intercept the messages. The protocols like IMAP allows a users to send emails and tons of others where the SSH has the protocol which allows us to communicate between two computers over the internet. We can share files and control or modify remote computers over the internet.

* Client ====> Secure Shell Protocol(SSH)+(Internet) ---> HOST
* ssh { user }@{ host }
* SSH Commands, Setupping with Digital Ocean, The workflow of SSH, Symmetric Encryption, Asymmetric Encryption and Hashing, SSH into a server, setupping SSh on Github.

## Working with Performance 1
### Task 2

* Keys of the performance and Network Performance, we need to check the internet speed of the webpage. Main website load performance because fast user experience is most important. We need to make our code more performance and website faster.

* Here, when the client browse the website for example we have a client a server. 

* How can we think critically about the performance and improve the process?

* Frontend(Client) + Backend(Server)
* 3 ways to speed up a website and applications. They are customer satisfaction, retention and conversion. 

* Firstly, we need to improve the client side which is frontend of the application. Because it needs time to render the page on the screen.

* Secondly, we can improve the transfer of our files over the wire. Network latency which has every request that needs time to travel from the client to the server and back.

* Thirdly, we can improve the processing done in the backend or backend processing. The web servers needs time to load data from the database and assemble the website. 

* Focus on to improve 90 percent of the speed. 

* Frontend needs to focus on improving in critical render path, optimized code and progressive web app(pwa).

* In Backend we need to focus on improving the CDNs, Caching, Load Balancing, DB Scaling and GZIP.

* Frontend + Backend = Minimize files + Minimize Delivery to improve the web app speed.

* <b>Network Performance:</b> we need to minimze and shrunk the files. Such as minimizing the text file like JS file, CSS files, and HTML files.We use UglyfyJS 3 Tools (Online Javascript minifier) to minimize the text file codes. This is a part of the build process.

* <b>Image File formats:</b> Next minimizing the images like JPG format files etc. This is important to think about which could slow the apps speed. Image file Formats like JGP, JPEG, SVG, GIF, PNG etc. SVG is called vector graphics.

#### <b>Image Optimization: </b>
To minimize images here we can follow these steps:
* If we want transparency to minimize images : we can use a <b>PNG</b>

* If we want animations: we can use <b>GIF</b>

* If we want colorful images: we can use <b>JPG</b>
* If we want to simple icons, logos and illustrations we can use <b>SVGs</b>

* To Reduce the PNG file we can use this tools:
   * **[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)**

* To Reduce the JPG file we can use this tools:
   * **[JPEG-optimizer](http://jpeg-optimizer.com/)**

* We can try to choose simple illustrations over highly detailed photographs.

* Always lower JPEG Image Quality (30%-60%)
* Resize image based on size it will be displayed.
* Display different sized images for different backgrounds.
* Use <b>CDNs</b> Tools like:
    * **[imigx](https://imgix.com/)**

* Remove image metadata.
