* SSH is known as Secure shell is a protocol. Such as, protocols are HTTP, HTTPS, FTP. HTTP is known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol which allow us to send files over the internet like a HTML, SS and JS files between browsers and servers.

HTTPS is alike to HTTP but its encrypted. The third parties can not read the files being transfered if they intercept the messages. The protocols like IMAP allows a users to send emails and tons of others where the SSH has the protocol which allows us to communicate between two computers over the internet.
